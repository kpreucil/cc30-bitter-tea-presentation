# cc30-bitter-tea-presentation

This is the code we presented for our in-class hackathon that our team won. Members included Tyson Gray and FrogBomb.

Bitter Tea is a Unit Testing game that we created. Essentially the user inputs functions and then can create unit tests for it. If the expected outcome is true the player gains a point, if false the player loses a point.

We are currently working on taking this project from being a working presentation to fully functional.

â€¦

to make in console:
>>  npm i
>>  gulp

The full project will be in the "dist" folder. Simply take the contents from that, put it on a server and it will run!
